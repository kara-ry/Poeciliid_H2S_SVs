# Poeciliid_H2S_SVs

This repository contains all scripts used to analyze data for the manuscript "Pangenome-based analysis reveals ecotype-associated structural variants across multiple locally adapted Poeciliid fishes." This includes scripts for:
- Quality control (01)
- Assembly of long haplotypes (02)
- Generation of Pangenome, long read mapping, and SV identification (03)
- SV identification with Sniffles (04)
- Identification of highly differentiated regions (05)
- Liftoff annotation (06)
- Population level genotyping of structural variants (07)

Raw data used for this analysis can be found on NBCI under Bioproject: PRJNA984711

Analysis was performed on a high-performance computer with a SLURM-based workload manager
